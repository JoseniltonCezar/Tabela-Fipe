## What is the Fipe Table?

The Fipe Table expresses average prices of vehicles advertised by sellers in the Brazilian market, serving only as a parameter for negotiations or evaluations. The prices actually practiced vary depending on the region, condition, color, accessories, or any other factor that may influence the supply and demand conditions for a specific vehicle.

The vehicle year refers to the model year and vehicles for professional or special use are not considered.

The values ​​are expressed in R$ (Brazilian Reais) of the month/year reference.
